                Hello! I'm Ang, an internal medical resident, and the creator of the Cantonese AI Tutor. My journey is driven by a deep-seated passion for oncology, technology, and finding new ways to make complex knowledge accessible to everyone.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 pt-4">My Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                As the son of Hong Kong-Canadian immigrants, I was inspired by my family's hard work and their dream of building a stable future. While that path initially seemed pointed toward traditional clinical practice, I found myself captivated by the power of technology to solve problems. My work in medicine, constantly reminds me of how rapidly knowledge is advancing. This "information explosion" sparked a desire to build tools that can help us all manage and learn more effectively. This tutor is a product of that visionâ€”a way to combine my heritage, my interest in technology, and my dedication to education.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 pt-4">Projects & Community</h2>
            <p>
                This all started with my YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AngStation" target="_blank" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline font-semibold">AngStation</a>. During the isolation of the COVID-19 lockdowns, I began hosting online study sessions. This grew into an amazing community of thousands of students who motivate each other while working toward their goals. The channel is my creative outlet to share lessons, experiences, and thoughts on navigating a career in medicine.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 pt-4">Beyond the Screen</h2>
            <p>
                When I'm not in the hospital or coding, I love to stay balanced and healthy through hiking and weightlifting. I'm also a huge science fiction enthusiast, always inspired by visions of a better future built with technology.
